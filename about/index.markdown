**Justin Acker** is a Brooklyn-based training coordinator, web dev., and hopeful indie game designer. By day, he codes and supports medical software. By night, he designs and researches independent videogames. By later at night - if he's been very, very good - he actually gets to play those videogames. When he has time, he writes blog posts about technology, coding, and videogame design and development.

Justin has had about a million jobs in a thousand different industries, and will gladly tell you all about them for the bargain-basement price of a good draft beer.

He is perpetually available for freelance and consulting work, and always entertaining offers for full-time employment in the gaming sector.
