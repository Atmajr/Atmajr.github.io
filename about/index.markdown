<img src="/images/justin.jpg" class="right" height="140" width="100"> **Justin
Acker** is a Brooklyn-based training coordinator, web developer, and hopefully
one day a game creator. By day, he codes and supports medical software. By
night, he designs and researches independent video games. By later at night - if
he's been very, very good - he actually gets to play those video games. When he
has time, he writes blog posts about technology, coding, and video game design
and development.

Justin has had about a million jobs in a thousand different industries, and will
gladly tell you all about them for the bargain-basement price of a good draft
beer.

He is perpetually available for freelance and consulting work, and always
entertaining offers for full-time employment in the software or gaming sectors.
