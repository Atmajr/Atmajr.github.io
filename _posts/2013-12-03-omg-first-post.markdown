This is my first post on my new Jekyll blog. I'm just trying things out so there's not much actual content here yet.

Oh look, you can insert ruby code:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Justin')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Oh look, is this how you do a [link?][qp]
